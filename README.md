Charity
-------

This is a demo of using Flask in Python to build websites.

We are going to build a website that allows visitors to pledge donations to
a charity. The website keeps a running total of the total donations and allows
visitors to submit more donation. Okay great.....


This is an incredible small sample with the two main files:

    charity.py           - implements the website backend
    templates/index.html - implements the website frontend

To run this sample, you will need python and install the flask module, e.g.

 - pip install flask
 - python charity.py

Then open a web browser to http://localhost:5000
